### Technical Explanation
**Cloud Services**:

* **AWS S3**: Used for storing property documents and media files.
* **AWS Lambda**: Handles serverless processing of API requests and automates workflows.
* **API Gateway**: Connects to government systems for property verification and payment gateways.
* **EC2 Instances**: Hosts the backend application, offering scalability as traffic increases.

**Communication**:

* Secure communication is ensured using HTTPS protocols between the system and external APIs (government, blockchain, banks).
* Asynchronous transactions are managed between external systems to ensure smooth data flow.

**Scaling**:

* The system will scale via AWS auto-scaling and Elastic Load Balancer to handle increasing numbers of users, transactions, and different government system integrations across countries.

### Security Plan
**Data Protection**:

* **Encryption**: Data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 for S3 and in transit via HTTPS.

**Authentication**:

* JWT is used for authentication, ensuring secure access to API endpoints.
* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive areas of the system, especially for admins or payment processes.

**Government and Payment APIs**:

* All communication with government and payment APIs is secured using SSL/TLS encryption.

**Compliance**:

* The system complies with GDPR and CCPA for data privacy, and all transactions follow PCI-DSS standards for payment data security.
