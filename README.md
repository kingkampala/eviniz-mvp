### Architectural Overview
This system is designed as a cloud-based solution for international real estate transactions, integrating with government systems and payment gateways.

**Components**:
* **User Devices**: Clients interact via web or mobile apps.

* **APIs**:

  * **Property Verification API**: Connects to various government systems (e.g., land registries, tax authorities) to verify property ownership, check for unpaid taxes, and resolve any disputes. It integrates with external APIs for real-time data pulling and validation.
  * **Payment API**: Provides two payment options:
    * **Blockchain Payments**: Supports secure property transactions via Ethereum or Hyperledger for transparency.
    * **Traditional Bank Transfer**: Connects with international payment gateways (e.g., SWIFT or SEPA).

* **Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)**:

  * **AWS EC2**: Hosts the backend application.
  * **AWS S3**: Stores property-related documents and media files securely.
  * **AWS Lambda**: Provides serverless processing for handling API requests and background tasks.
  * **API Gateway**: Manages secure API interactions with government systems, payment networks, and external services.

* **Database**: Uses PostgreSQL to store user data, property records, and payment history, ensuring scalability and performance.

* **Security**:

  * HTTPS ensures secure communication between clients and the backend.
  * JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication, with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive operations.
  * **Data Encryption**: All data is encrypted both at rest and in transit to comply with GDPR and CCPA regulations.

**Flow**:
* **User Interaction**: Users initiate property transactions or payments from client devices.
* **Property Verification**: The system pulls real-time data from government APIs to validate seller information, property ownership, and legality.
* **Payment Processing**: Users can choose between blockchain or traditional payment methods, with secure tracking and storage of the transaction.
* **Cloud & Database**: The backend (hosted on AWS EC2) processes the request, storing or retrieving information from the PostgreSQL database, with media stored on S3. AWS Lambda functions handle additional serverless tasks.
* **Scalability**: The system is built with scalability in mind, leveraging AWS auto-scaling and multi-region capabilities to ensure low latency and high availability.

### Technical Explanation
**Cloud Services**:

* **AWS S3**: Used for storing property documents and media files.
* **AWS Lambda**: Handles serverless processing of API requests and automates workflows.
* **API Gateway**: Connects to government systems for property verification and payment gateways.
* **EC2 Instances**: Hosts the backend application, offering scalability as traffic increases.

**Communication**:

* Secure communication is ensured using HTTPS protocols between the system and external APIs (government, blockchain, banks).
* Asynchronous transactions are managed between external systems to ensure smooth data flow.

**Scaling**:

* The system will scale via AWS auto-scaling and Elastic Load Balancer to handle increasing numbers of users, transactions, and different government system integrations across countries.

### Security Plan
**Data Protection**:

* **Encryption**: Data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 for S3 and in transit via HTTPS.

**Authentication**:

* JWT is used for authentication, ensuring secure access to API endpoints.
* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive areas of the system, especially for admins or payment processes.

**Government and Payment APIs**:

* All communication with government and payment APIs is secured using SSL/TLS encryption.

**Compliance**:

* The system complies with GDPR and CCPA for data privacy, and all transactions follow PCI-DSS standards for payment data security.
